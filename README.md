fifthRectWidth: The width of the fifth white rectangle
fifthRectHeight: The height of the fifth white rectangle
fifthRectXOffset: The x offset of the fifth white rectangle
fifthRectYOffset: The y offset of the fifth white rectangle

Each of my letters are comprised of a 100x200 box, filled with diagonal black lines, and then overlayed with a varying number of white rectangles, to create the illusion of negative space. The diagonal lines also add another layer of illusion to the letters, making them appear as though they are on an angle, when they're actually perfectly upright. I spent a good amount of time in the holidays going through both past students work and keeping an eye out for any designs I liked while going about my day to day stuff back home in Wanaka. Initially I wanted to try and create a font with some kind of angle on it, like italics, but I couldn't find an easy way to create the angle in the letters without having an insane number of variables (not that that really changed in the end, I still ended up with 20). But during the holidays I ended up going to Puzzling World in Wanaka with my family, which has tons and tons of visual illusions as attractions you can walk through and interact with. Funnily enough, one of them is a room placed on a ramp, but everything on the room is laid out as if the floor of the room isn't on an angle, which made me think 'why not instead of trying to make the font on an angle, I make everything but the text on an angle, so that the contrast makes the text appear on an angle, despite the fact it's the only part of my font that isn't. I played around with individual letters for a while, and on their own, the angle effect wasn't that strong, but once I started placing their values in the alphabet.html file so they all appeared together, the effect looked way stronger. Most of the letters and numbers I'm really happy with, but there are definitely a few of both that I'm not super happy with too, mostly letters and numbers that look similar to each other. Z and 2, S and 5, and D, O and 0 were all a pain to try and differentiate, especially D, O and 0. When I showed my work to my dad, he suggested maybe add a / through the 0 to make it obviously different to an O, but that led me back to my initial issue of making the text look angled without adding way more parameters to my existing design, so I ended up making the D look like a hybrid of an uppercase D and lowercase d, the O has some small white boxes in its corners to try and make it look somewhat rounded, and the 0 I left as a simple circle.

Overall, I really enjoyed this project, both coming up with ideas for the design, and trying to find a (somewhat) compact way to implement my ideas as code. If I was to repeat this project with my current ideas, I would definitely give the italic style text another attempt, as while it didn't work out in the end, I think with the experience I've gained during this project and a little more time, I could make it work.
